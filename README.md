We aspire to change lives positively and are dedicated to being one of the best providers in the area.

Our reputation as a NDIS support provider is built on valuing the dreams of our participants (clients), empowering them to achieve what was perceived to be impossible, and accompanying them and their families in changing their lives for the better.

We take pride in our holistic approach to care, assist, support and connect individuals and professionals with a personalised plan that is developed and tailored to their needs.
Our skilled team will not only inspire and empower you but will also help you see things from a new perspective, encouraging you to dream big and not let your disability define you.

From participants to staff members, Empower Living as a whole is passionate about guiding, supporting, and empowering individuals and creating opportunities for personal and professional skills development.

Our biggest goal is to impact lives by building bridges and connections, and we are genuinely committed to helping our clients achieve the impossible.
